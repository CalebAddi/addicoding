        <p>My name is Caleb, and I'm a Software Engineer.</p>

        <p>As a Software Engineer, I work on various gameplay systems by developing them using both C++ and Blueprint Scripting for a game called The Wayward Realms. 
            Previously, I worked on various game projects while freelancing for clients, developing their ideas into playable games. 
            While freelancing, I also created websites for clients. I also worked for Ocean Aero where I worked on the Fullstack Development of the GUI for the Triton,
            which is their autonomous boat.
